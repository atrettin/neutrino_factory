# Design decisions

Architectural rationale and caveats. Append new decisions here.

## Dual container pathways: Docker locally, Apptainer on the cluster (2026-07)

**Decision.** Generators (and, on the cluster, the CLI itself) run in
containers under one of two runtimes selected by `NF_CONTAINER_RUNTIME`:
Docker for local development, Apptainer for the MPCDF/ODSL cluster. Earlier
docs claimed Docker was the long-term HPC strategy; that was wrong — the
cluster forbids Docker (root escalation) and supports only Apptainer.

**Why env-driven runtime selection (not YAML).** The same run config must work
unchanged on the laptop and the cluster; only the machine differs. Runtime and
image location are machine facts, so they live in the environment
(`NF_CONTAINER_RUNTIME`, `NF_IMAGE_ROOT`), persisted per checkout in the
repo-root `.env` written by `neutrino-factory setup`. Precedence: real env >
`.env` > defaults.

## Unified Apptainer runtime image on the cluster

**Decision.** On the cluster, Python still never launches containers from
inside Python. However, Slurm now enters one unified runtime image
(`nf-base.sif`) for every task, and that image provides both the framework
Python runtime and generator entry wrappers.

**Why.**
- Apptainer-in-Apptainer does not work on this cluster (user-tested), so the
  local Docker pattern (Python wraps the generator in a container command)
  still cannot transfer.
- MPCDF removed the module system; the host Python is 3.9. Any modern Python
  must itself come from a container.
- MPCDF auto-mounts `/u`, `/ptmp`, `/cvmfs` inside containers, so host paths
  resolve unchanged inside. (`/scratch` turned out not to be mounted inside
  containers, so the project dropped its scratch-root concept entirely —
  everything lives on `/ptmp`.)

**Consequences.**
- The native-binary-first ordering in every adapter's `build_run_command`
  remains load-bearing on the cluster.
- The unified `nf-base.sif` carries one Python runtime plus framework
  dependencies; the project code is still provided from the repo checkout via
  `PYTHONPATH`, so code changes need no image rebuild.
- `sbatch` is invisible inside containers, so `submit` prints the `sbatch`
  command for the user to run in a host shell instead of failing.

## Hand-written Apptainer definitions (no spython, no image transfer)

**Decision.** Each `setup/apptainer/<gen>.def` is written by hand, mirroring
its `setup/Dockerfile.<gen>` (multi-stage structure preserved via `Stage:` +
`%files from`), and SIFs are built natively on odslserv01/02. No
Docker-tarball transfer, no registry.

**Why.** Automated Dockerfile→def translation (spython) is unreliable for
multi-stage Dockerfiles and would add a dependency for a one-shot command;
native cluster builds avoid multi-GB image transfers and produce genuinely
native x86_64 binaries (also isolating the GENIE MEC crash, which was only
seen under amd64 emulation). The cost is deliberate duplication: **Dockerfile
and def must be updated together** (each def's header names its source).

**Divergences allowed between the pairs**: defs drop `--platform` pinning, add
the Python runtime deps, and (NuWro) relocate the ROOTEGPythia6 build dir out
of `/tmp`, because Apptainer bind-mounts the host `/tmp` over the image's at
runtime and would shadow the baked-in dictionary path.
