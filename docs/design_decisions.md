# Design decisions

Architectural rationale and caveats. Append new decisions here.

## Dual container pathways: Docker locally, Apptainer on the cluster (2026-07)

**Decision.** Generators (and, on the cluster, the CLI itself) run in
containers under one of two runtimes selected by `NF_CONTAINER_RUNTIME`:
Docker for local development, Apptainer for the MPCDF/ODSL cluster. Earlier
docs claimed Docker was the long-term HPC strategy; that was wrong — the
cluster forbids Docker (root escalation) and supports only Apptainer.

**Why env-driven runtime selection (not YAML).** The same run config must work
unchanged on the laptop and the cluster; only the machine differs. Runtime and
image location are machine facts, so they live in the environment
(`NF_CONTAINER_RUNTIME`, `NF_IMAGE_ROOT`), persisted per checkout in the
repo-root `.env` written by `neutrino-factory setup`. Precedence: real env >
`.env` > defaults.

## Unified Apptainer runtime image on the cluster

**Decision.** On the cluster, Python still never launches containers from
inside Python. However, Slurm now enters one unified runtime image
(`nf-base.sif`) for every task, and that image provides both the framework
Python runtime and generator entry wrappers.

**Why.**
- Apptainer-in-Apptainer does not work on this cluster (user-tested), so the
  local Docker pattern (Python wraps the generator in a container command)
  still cannot transfer.
- MPCDF removed the module system; the host Python is 3.9. Any modern Python
  must itself come from a container.
- MPCDF auto-mounts `/u`, `/ptmp`, `/cvmfs` inside containers, so host paths
  resolve unchanged inside. (`/scratch` turned out not to be mounted inside
  containers, so the project dropped its scratch-root concept entirely —
  everything lives on `/ptmp`.)

**Consequences.**
- The native-binary-first ordering in every adapter's `build_run_command`
  remains load-bearing on the cluster.
- The unified `nf-base.sif` carries one Python runtime plus framework
  dependencies; the project code is still provided from the repo checkout via
  `PYTHONPATH`, so code changes need no image rebuild.
- `sbatch` is invisible inside containers, so `submit` prints the `sbatch`
  command for the user to run in a host shell instead of failing.

## Hand-written Apptainer definitions (no spython, no image transfer)

**Decision.** Each `setup/apptainer/<gen>.def` is written by hand, mirroring
its `setup/Dockerfile.<gen>` (multi-stage structure preserved via `Stage:` +
`%files from`), and SIFs are built natively on odslserv01/02. No
Docker-tarball transfer, no registry.

**Why.** Automated Dockerfile→def translation (spython) is unreliable for
multi-stage Dockerfiles and would add a dependency for a one-shot command;
native cluster builds avoid multi-GB image transfers and produce genuinely
native x86_64 binaries (native builds also helped rule emulation out as the
cause of the GENIE MEC crash, later traced to ROOT being built without
Minuit2). The cost is deliberate duplication: **Dockerfile
and def must be updated together** (each def's header names its source).

**Divergences allowed between the pairs**: defs drop `--platform` pinning, add
the Python runtime deps, and (NuWro) relocate the ROOTEGPythia6 build dir out
of `/tmp`, because Apptainer bind-mounts the host `/tmp` over the image's at
runtime and would shadow the baked-in dictionary path.

## Discovery-based, version-namespaced Apptainer composition

**Decision.** `nf-base.sif` is composed by *auto-discovering* every built
per-generator payload SIF from the catalog, not from a fixed generator list.
Each payload stages a **self-contained, version-namespaced** tree under
`/opt/nf/generators/<gen>/<code_version>/` and ships its own `bin/<binary>`
wrapper plus an `nf-payload.json` descriptor. `build_apptainer_images.sh`
generates the composed def (one `localimage` stage + one generic `%files` copy
per payload) and `nf-base.def` is a generator-agnostic tail that installs a
single `nf-run <gen> <code_version> <binary>` dispatcher and descriptor-driven
default-version symlinks. Under the apptainer runtime each adapter's
`build_run_command` rewrites the native command to the explicit `nf-run` form
via `containers.apptainer_dispatch`.

**Why.**
- Extensibility was the requirement: adding a generator or a new version of an
  existing one must not touch `nf-base.def` or the build script's generator
  logic. Discovery + generated stages achieve that; the only inputs are a
  `<gen>.def` and a `CODE_VERSIONS` entry (with `build_arg_name`).
- **Multiple versions of one generator must coexist** in the same image.
  Version-namespaced payload paths + explicit `nf-run` version dispatch make
  that possible; distinct image tags (`<name>:<code_version>`) already yield
  distinct SIF filenames.
- Per-generator env/launch knowledge was duplicated in up to five places, with
  the *richest* form (NuWro's `-i/-o` absolutize + `cd`, GiBUU's binary `find`)
  living wrongly inside `nf-base.def`. Moving it into each payload's shipped
  wrapper makes the payload the single source of truth.

**Consequences / trade-offs.**
- The adapters' native-binary-first probe (`shutil.which`) is preserved by
  keeping bare default-version symlinks; the executed command still names the
  version explicitly. Detection logic is unchanged — **do not reorder those
  branches.**
- Payloads bundle their own ROOT, so `nf-base.sif` grows roughly linearly with
  the number of composed versions (accepted: recompose is fast, disk on
  `/ptmp`). GiBUU's ROOT (from the `rootproject/root` base) is folded into its
  payload; NuWro keeps relying on `libpcre3` from `nf-base.def`'s fixed runtime
  baseline rather than bundling it, to avoid perturbing the ROOT-linked
  generators that also need it.
- Wrappers are **self-locating** (`readlink -f "$0"`), so their text is
  version-independent and `{{ }}` templating is confined to `%files`/
  `%environment`/`%test` (never inside a quoted `%post` heredoc).
- Code versions must be filesystem-safe: `nf-run` and payload staging apply the
  same `[^A-Za-z0-9._-]→_` transform, so the dispatch arg and the on-disk
  directory never diverge.
- Moving wrappers out of `nf-base.def` touches no Dockerfile; the
  `/opt/nf/generators/<cv>` staging is Apptainer-composition-only and has no
  Docker counterpart, so the "update both together" pairing is not triggered.
